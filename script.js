Just 51% of players hit the green in regulation on this hole to give themselves a birdie putt. The safe play is to find the middle of the green, safely carrying the front bunker.

Players who successfully hug the left treeline with their tee shot are rewarded with a flatter lie and a shorter approach to the green, but a tributary of Rae's Creek will errant drives that drift too far to the left. The safer shot is to aim right, but this leaves a longer approach from the steep slope that frames the right side of the fairway.

Players that drive the ball 300-plus yards will see their birdie odds jump from 29% to 58% by finding the right side of the fairway versus the center. On the other side, drives that end up short of the trees on the left side result in a birdie or better only 31% of the time."
